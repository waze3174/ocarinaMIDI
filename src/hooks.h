/* The game's controller reads, through main's GOT. Module init only hooks two setup imports
 * (nn::hid::InitializeNpad and GetNpadStyleSet); the first call to either, from the game after every
 * module's DT_INIT has run, points the GetNpadStates slots at wrappers that call whatever the slots
 * held then (another module's wrapper, such as sloperinaGZ's, or the sdk). So the order rtld runs the
 * modules' DT_INITs in doesn't matter, and a module that rewrites those slots at its init without
 * chaining can't undo ours. */
